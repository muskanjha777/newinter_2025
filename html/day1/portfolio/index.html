   <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm Muskan Jha, a passionate and dedicated software developer currently pursuing my diploma in Computer Engineering. Ever since I started exploring the world of technology, I've been deeply fascinated by how code can turn ideas into powerful digital experiences. Whether it's developing responsive websites, working with databases, or exploring the logic behind clean and efficient code, I thrive on solving problems and continuously learning.

    I believe that great software is built not just with good code, but with a clear understanding of user needs, creativity, and strong attention to detail. Through various academic and personal projects, I‚Äôve developed a strong foundation in languages like Java, C++, and JavaScript, and tools like Git, VS Code, and Figma. I'm currently interning at Rich System Solutions, where I‚Äôm gaining hands-on experience with real-world development and teamwork.

    Apart from coding, I‚Äôm also passionate about UI/UX design, creating user-friendly interfaces, and bringing a clean, modern touch to every project I work on. My goal is to become a full-stack developer and eventually build impactful software solutions that make people‚Äôs lives easier. I‚Äôm a learner, a dreamer, and someone who‚Äôs ready to take on any challenge with a smile and strong determination.

    Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating it!
