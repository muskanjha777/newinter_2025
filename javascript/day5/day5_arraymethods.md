âœ… What Are Array Methods in JavaScript?
Array methods in JavaScript are built-in functions that allow you to perform common operations on arrays, such as:

Adding or removing elements

Searching or filtering elements

Transforming or sorting elements

Iterating over elements

They make working with arrays easier and more powerful by reducing the need for manual loops.

ðŸ“¦ Example Array:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
Now you can use array methods like:

.map() â†’ to transform each number

.filter() â†’ to get only certain numbers

.reduce() â†’ to combine all numbers into one value

.push() â†’ to add a number

.pop() â†’ to remove the last number

.sort() â†’ to sort the numbers

.splice() â†’ to add or remove items at specific positions
