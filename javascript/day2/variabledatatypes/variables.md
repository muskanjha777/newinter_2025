#varibles in javascript
Variables in JavaScript are containers that hold reusable data. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution. A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location. In JavaScript, all the variables must be declared before they can be used. Variables can be declared in three different ways.
//ex code
// Numbers:
let length = 16;
let weight = 7.5;

// Strings:
let color = "Yellow";
let lastName = "kapoor";

// Booleans
let x = true;
let y = false;

// Object:
const person = {firstName:"musk", lastName:"jha"};

// Array object:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// Date object:
const date = new Date("2022-03-25");
